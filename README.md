## Here's a Nice, Basic Calculator App

This calculator app was [initially](https://github.com/lethabomathabatha/practice-projects/blob/main/javascript-beginner-project.html) built in March 2023, featuring HTML and CSS, with the JavaScript written within the HTML as illustrated in [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGgLHJGyS34&t=21s).

I have since extracted the JavaScript from the HTML file and rewritten it as a stand-alone script.

### So what does it do?
As a calculator, it processes user input with mathematical operators and returns the _calculated_ result. This calculator allows the user to perform basic arithmetic operations, namely - addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.

### Key features:
- the display area is set as read-only so that values cannot directly be typed in and appended to any values on the display area
- the **AC**(All Clear) button clears any values from the display area
- the **DE**(Delete) button removes the last entered value from the display
- number values from **0 to 9**, as well as a **00** for quicker multi-digit calculations
- the **.** allows for decimal calculations
- the **=** evaluates the entered expression and retuens the result
- the +, -, * and \ mathematical operators process the entered values and are further evaluated by the =
- the JavaScript code uses event listeners to capture _clicks_ and perform the corresponding operations
